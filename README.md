# Invoice Generator


An invoice generator used to generate an invoice for a customer after the customer must have selected the service/services needed. The invovice generator shows the customer the total cost of services to be provided. This invoice generator was a project to test my javascript skills after the javascript course I took on scrimba.

## Technologies Used
1. Html5
2. Css3 
3. Javascript
 

## Challenges
1. I had a hard time figuring the logic on how to add the total cost of services provided as the buttons were clicked, regardless of the order in which they were clicked and also without hardcoding the values.

## What I learnt

1. I learnt how to add event listeners on buttons
2. After thorough google search, I learnt how to add numbers together using javascript as a button is clicked , without hardcoding the values.
